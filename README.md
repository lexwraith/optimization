###Monogamy Problem###
Exploratory work using Minizinc in solving the "monogamy" problem
where X number of men are to be paired up with Y number of women,
where X_1_1 to X_X_Y are preferences for each woman. Or we can swap
genders. It doesn't really matter. Please don't accuse me of sexism.

###Matchmaking Problem###
Using Sage/GLPK (and potentially other solvers) to maximize the weight
of existing edges in complete graph A when splitting into K complete graphs.

In other words, breaking up a group of X people in to K groups such that
we minimize the "loss connections" between people while maximizing
the overall happiness of each group due to inter-group relations.
